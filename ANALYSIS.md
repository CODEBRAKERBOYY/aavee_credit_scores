## ðŸ”¢ Score Range Buckets

| Score Range | Wallet Count | Observations |

| **100 - 200** |  Slightly better, but mostly inactive or liquidated |
| **200 - 400** |  Mixed usage, some repayments, not highly active |
| **400 - 700** |  Good users: active across several actions, no liquidation |
| **700 - 1000**|  Strong behavior: high repay ratios, no liquidations, high activity |

Further improvements can include:
- Time-decay on activity
- Transaction volume normalization
- Token-specific behavior scoring
